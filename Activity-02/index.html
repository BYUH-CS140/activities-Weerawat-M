            System, and that is to provide a capstone experience for students of Oceania and the Asian Rim. 
            BYU–Hawaii brings together countries and cultures in ways that no other university can. 
            Our mission is to be and build people who follow the example of Christ. 
            This capstone experience prepares students to be lifelong disciples of Christ 
            who can be leaders and examples of intercultural peace."</i><sub>PRESIDENT JOHN S.K. KAUWE III</sub></p>
